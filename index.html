              Saving nature is at the very heart of what we do as WWF. For more than 50 years, we have made it our mission to find solutions
              that save the marvelous array of life on our planet by applying the best science available and working closely
              with local communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              But our work is far from done. Humans are behind the current rate of species extinction, which is at least 100–1,000 times
              higher than nature intended. WWF’s 2016 Living Planet Report found global populations of fish, birds, mammals,
              amphibians and reptiles declined by 58% between 1970 and 2012.
            </p>
            <p>And the impacts will reach far beyond the potential cultural loss of iconic species like tigers, rhinos and whales.
            </p>
            <p>The good news is we’ve also seen what’s working. WWF has been part of successful wildlife recovery stories ranging
              from southern Africa’s black rhino to black bucks in the Himalayas. And this in turn is helping protect rich
              and varied ecosystems while ensuring people continue to benefit from nature.
            </p>
            <p>This much is clear: we cannot afford to fail in our mission to save a living planet.

                  By protecting species, we also protect the essential goods and services that make our lives possible and contribute enormously
                  to human health and well-being — breathable air, clean water, food, fibers, building materials, medicines,
                  energy, fertile soils, climate regulation, transport, and recreational and spiritual values.

                <p>
                  The cuddly black-and-white giant panda is a conservation icon and not only because it is WWF’s widely recognized logo. They
                  are reigning celebrities in the handful of zoos around the world where people flock to see them. Numbering
                  around 1,600 in the wild, China is the only country where giant pandas are found. WWF has played an important
                  role in their recovery for over 30 years, ever since we became the first private conservation group to
                  receive an official invitation from the Chinese government in 1978.

                  It speaks to the power of the mighty predator that the first-ever global summit on a single species brought together world
                  leaders to commit to a single purpose—doubling the number of wild tigers by 2022. WWF is playing a pivotal
                  role in realizing this ambitious goal, which will ensure the king of the jungle will once again thrive
                  across its range in 13 countries to benefit other wildlife and wild spaces, secure freshwater sources and
                  a future for people too.

              rhino, the Javan rhinoceros has a single horn (the other extant species have two horns). Its horn is the smallest
              of all extant rhinos, usually less than 20 cm (7.9 in) with the longest recorded only 27 cm (11 in). Only males
              have horns.

            <p>The Irrawaddy dolphin is similar to the beluga in appearance, though most closely related to the killer whale.
              It has a large melon and a blunt, rounded head, and the beak is indistinct. The dorsal fin, located about two-thirds
              posterior along the back, is short, blunt, and triangular. The flippers are long and broad. It is lightly coloured
              all over, but slightly more white on the underside than the back.
